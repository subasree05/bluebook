      <h2>Download</h2>

      <p>At the moment there is no pre-built Bluebook binary available for download. You will have to
      install Bluebook from the <a href="https://github.com/bluebookrun/bluebook">source code</a>.
      To install Bluebook from source code you will need to have Go &gt;= 1.8 on your computer.
      Follow <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">Go installation instructions</a> on its official site.
      When Go is setup you can install Bluebook with the following command</p>

      <pre>$ go get -u github.com/bluebookrun/bluebook</pre>

      <p>If installation was successful, you should find <code>bluebook</code> in your executable path.</p>
